relational data. The Winds of Winter by George RR Martin.
the relational data between "by" and the authors name.
unless if it defines an author or by we are going to add Unknown in the hash.
Making a hash that ties titles to authors.

what does each funciton do?
it will cycle through teh hash and grab each key value pair.

each(%allitems)

Search for authors by passing an arguement in the command line.

also possible to use grep to search instead of passing a arguement. I should practice the passing arguements so i know how to code that.

dealing with order in hashes



REFERENCES!!!
Variables 

dereference a scalar variable $scalar with \

reference
referent 
dereferencing

references are scalars

array reference

@
$
@$
\$


in perl all arrays are multi dimensional

colums rows for 2d arrays. playing battle ship.

nested for loops to print the array

printing rows and column data

$md_array[0]->[0] = 0;

in fix operators

creating and referencing arrays inside of arrays.


Lists of List
shopping lists, arrays are lists.
notepad grocery list, costco list, petsmart list
map that data into a perl array or list.
add two items to the list

foreach loops with counters

use a C style for loop instead of foreach loop. for incremental i++ j++ counting. initialize variable in one line inside loop for(i=0; i++){}

add labels to those shopping lists.

Hashes of Lists.
Point your Hash to your array.



for(i=0; i++;){
print $array[i];
}


put your data in a database and not in a program.

I need a Database for my contacts.

Dig through my dads old data for contacts. with perl scripts.

hash of hashes will work faster then a hash and array insdie array or something. use relational data to cut through data and get what you need.
